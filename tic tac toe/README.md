# Creating a tic tac toe game 
- Which will be played with mouse only
- will be running on windows to support mouse action
- will count score and present it: including tie and amount of games until run ends
- will have option to play against computer or against a different player
- make sure to have an option to exit gracefully besides keyboard interuptions.
- Add option to name players to differ between them
- Add color to differ between players in board


## Just ideas that can be done if the future
- Add option to open a window for the game
- Add option to change the O and X to other strings for example ( . )( . ) 
- Add option to use mouse (this is a side feature if this cannot be done in terminal.)
